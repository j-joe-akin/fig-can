Here is our roadmap! 

# Short-term Figure Canvas milestones:

1. Create “sandbox” which accepts image files by drag-and-drop from another page (import)
  * add feature to figcan.html: drag-and-drop image import
2. Test “sandbox” functionality with images imported from a variety of open science repositories
3. Test user experience with import of images 
4. Brainstorm what experimental parameters can be imported with the image into “sandbox”
5. Brainstorm how these experimental parameters can be imported and displayed


# Long-term Figure Canvas milestones:

1. Create engaging user experience for import and display of open source science results
2. Integrate into database meant to store user “bins” of reproduced data
