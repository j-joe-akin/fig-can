# fig-can

FigureCanvas, or fig-can, is a seamless way to visualize repeats of scientific experiments. We’re making it easy to see how robust a given scientific result is. It's like version control for a particular scientific experiment, or hypothesis.

Interested in helping? Thanks for making it this far!

My name is Joe. My friend Girija and I are scientists, and we believe in open science.

We think making the repeats of single experiments more transparent will do many amazing and incredible things to our world. For example, we can figure(canvas) out just how bad and just how good coffee/wine/chocolate is for our health.
Check out our mockup [here](img/fig-can-mockup.png)!
