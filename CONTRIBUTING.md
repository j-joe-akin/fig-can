# For graphic designers

1. We need a FigureCanvas logo; click here for inspirations.

# For UX specialists

1. We need a mockup of 5 figures with 8 related parameter/value pairs listed for each figure. Figures will share a majority of the same parameters (e.g. cell concentration, plate type, etc.); some figures will share only a few; some parameters will only be listed for 1 figure.

# For project managers

1. Please review our ROADMAP

# For developers

1. Create “sandbox” in browser window/tab which accepts image files by drag-and-drop from another page (import)
2. Upon drag and drop other nearby information is collected and displayed along with figure as an additional object
3. Test “sandbox” functionality with images imported from a variety of open science repositories; click here for a list of open science, single-figure repositories
